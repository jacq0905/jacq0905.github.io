<h3>Dear The Unlovable</h3>
<br>
	You've been the greatest person ever in my life, the one that made me feel happiest, 
	the one that made me feel the most joy the one that allowed me to live as if it was 
	sorrow-free. Your smile is undoubtably my favourite, your smile makes me smile the 
	moment i see it, no one in my life has made me feel like this, no one has made me feel
	so alive and happy. im sorry that this day has to come, ill be honest, i was naive, 
	i was stubborn, i thought i knew what i was doing and i thought i was mature, i couldnt 
	have been more wrong. i regret dating you, not because i had a bad time with you, but 
	because the amount of sorrow  and pain i brought to you. if i did'nt have dated u, you 
	would'nt have to experience all this and far less from being hurt im so sorry that my 
	immaturity and naive-ness brought this pain to you, im so sorry that i disrespected ur 
	parents in turn  for you. i'm really happy that, i got the chance to spend these 9 months 
	with you, even if i had to deal with all the sorrow and pain, even if i had to deal with 
	the consequences of falling into true love knowing that the chances of it ending is high,
	but i made the decision, the wrong one.

<br>
	Eventhough i got the spend the happiest 9 months i ever had, it hurts so much to know that, 
	in turn for my happiness, in turn for your love, i have to deal with you having to leave, 
	but more importantly i have to deal with the fact that, i did something that hurt you.
	my immaturity brought all of this to you, and i can't regret more because i don't even 
	want to imagine you being upset, far less with the fact that i caused it. im so sorry m'love, 
	i rlly am, i should've known better. im so sorry for dating you, for causing all this pain 
	to you, im so sorry that i disrespected your parents, just for you. i should've thought of 
	how your parents wouldve felt, i can't be more sorry. i learnt, grew, and matured alot with 
	you and i can't appreciate it more but it's my time to face the consequences now. i'm sorry,
	im sorry for my selfishness. i love you, i really do alot.
